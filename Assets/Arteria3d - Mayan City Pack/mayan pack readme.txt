THankyou for purchasing this quality pack from Arteria3d.

You will find folders containing various game formats, along with separate folders for the textures.  We have provided the original 409x4096 textures and also
lower size 2048x2048 textures.  Although both are large size textures, the whole pack uses only a small combination of textures, totalling even with the high res
textures to no more than 70meg of texture usage, whilst the lower res totals around 20 meg or so.

When using in your engine, simply copy the format over you wish to use, and copy the entire folder of whicever texture res you wish to use.  I.e. entire contents
of either high res, or lower res


For unity users, use FBX format for best results

I hope you enjoy using the pack

Best wishes

Steve, Arteria3d
